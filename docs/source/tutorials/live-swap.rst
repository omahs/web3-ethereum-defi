   :description: Python example code for Uniswap swap live monitoring

Uniswap v2 reading real-time swaps and new pairs
------------------------------------------------

This is the Python example code for `Uniswap <https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/uniswap>`__
v2 compatible `DEX <https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/decentralised-exchange>`__ swap live monitoring.

This is an example code for showing live swaps happening
on Uniswap v2 `compatible <https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/fork>`__ exchanges.
In this example we use QuickSwap (Polygon) because Polygon provides
good free RPC nodes which makes running the example code easy.

- This example runs on free Polygon JSON-RPC nodes,
  you do not need any self-hosted or commercial node service providers.

- The code supports chain reorganisation detection: minor blockchain reorganisations
  happen regularly, the latest block is rolled back and replaced
  by new block with reordered events.

- This is a modified example of `read-uniswap-v2-pairs-and-swaps.py` to gracefully handle
  chain reorganisations, thus the code is suitable for live event reading.
  It should also support low quality JSON-RPC nodes that may give different replies between API requests.

- It will print out live trade events for Uniswap v2 compatible exchange.

- This will also show how to track block headers on disk,
  so that next start up is faster.

- This is a dummy example just showing how to build the live loop,
  because how stores are constructed it is not good for processing
  actual data.

- Because pair and token details are dynamically fetched
  when a swap for a pair is encountered for the first time,
  the startup is a bit slow as the pair details cache
  is warming up.

To run for Polygon (and QuickSwap):

.. code-block:: shell

    # Need for nice output
    pip install coloredlogs

    # Switch between INFO and DEBUG
    export LOG_LEVEL=INFO
    # Your Ethereum node RPC
    export JSON_RPC_POLYGON="https://polygon-rpc.com"
    python scripts/read-uniswap-v2-swaps-live.py
